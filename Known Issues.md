# Known Issues
- There is clipping if you try to give her a helmet/hood. She also has a custom body (started from CBBE). If you attempt to change her clothes, you may not like what you see. 
- Katana's mounting behavior can be odd.
- Katana will sometimes go her own way. 
### Workarounds
- Try bashing Katana.
- Use her summon spell if she has disappeared.
