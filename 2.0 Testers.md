### Hello, and thank you for agreeing to test 2.0!

#### Updated August 29, 2023
To make things easier for everyone, I've listed everything that I think needs multiple sets of fresh eyes. The version you are testing does not have complete voice files. *This means you need the correct version of [Fuz Ro D-oh - Silent Voice](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15109) for your game.*

**Just a note that the FOMOD is an auto-detect installer. If you don't have a file, example: Khajiit Speak Redux, please do not click on the box in the FOMOD.**

**Again, thank you so much for your time, and sorry about the size! Waiting for all voices to be sent before I process that.** :revolving_hearts:

**Objective: Try to break things with normal player stuff that a dev may miss. Please see the General section.**

### Intro
- Go to the Winking Skeever
- Recruit Katana upstairs
- Talk after recruiting to get the feather + the quest timer begins
- Wait 1 hour, then talk
- Wait 3 hours, then talk
- Wait 3 hours, then talk
- Wait 6 hours (make sure you are not in Whiterun), then talk

### Apothecary

### COTN Winterhold
- Any issues?

### JK's Drunken Huntsman
- Any issues?

### JK's Bee and Barb
- Any issues?

### General
# MOST IMPORTANT TO TEST: What are your thoughts on the frequency of idle lines?
- Katana and Megara were not designed to be chatty. There are `4,747` lines in total for the mod, and most are naturally their lines. But I designed them for those that prefer quieter followers with a lot of lines, and myself.
- I have made it so that many generic idles have a day in the week when they should play. 
- Unique idles should take precedence over anything else.
- If playing as a werewolf, are you hearing comments about your transformation?
- If playing as a vampire, are you hearing comments when you feed?
- Other feedback? :)

### Chasing the Current
- Play as someone that does not trust Katana.
- Play as someone that trusts Katana.
- When you go to Kilerth's Rest, you can actually just attack Elli and skip that entire scene. The scene after the battle has to play, though.

### Megara 
- Read [this document](https://github.com/annakins/Katana/blob/main/Megara's%20Buffs.md) to gather potions to test buff system.
- Install [Wounds](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17581) AND my Wounds patch in FOMOD and see if there are any issues with this feature.
- Ask to be cured when sick and not sick.
- Test radiant bounty quests. You should no longer get sent to Solstheim.
- Ask to hold back in combat so she just heals you without fighting.
- Test sneak/sheathe torch feature (sneak = torch goes away).
- Ask Megara to put torch away. See if a torch spawns. Shouldn't.
- Ask Megara to go back to using a torch. Back to awesome default behavior.

### Katana
- Test scouting package (after Chasing the Current).
- What are your thoughts on the shade she summons in combat (after Chasing the Current)?
- Test bounty feature (after Chasing the Current): "Do you have bounties to handle?" Katana is gone within this range: **4 hours to 3 days**. She comes back to you when she's done AND you enter a new location.
- Try giving Katana a torch and see what happens. This isn't instant.
- Test hold back package.
- Test shadow package.

### Katana's Trust system
- See if you can get reactions from the following:
    - Brawls Won
    - Houses Owned
    - Dragon Souls Collected
    - Shouts Mastered
    - Weapon Made
    - Armor Made
    - Weapon Improved
    - Bribes**
    - Pickpocketing**
    - Murders**
    - Bunnies Slaughtered**
    - Items Stolen**
- These are set to NOT play all the time. I have a `GetRandomPercent` in the conditions so you don't get spammed.
- Erm... attack innocent animals and see what reactions you get :(
- Also attack innocent people and see what happens.
- Talk to Katana and say, `I want to talk about my lifestyle...` and then `It's... special. Look away when I "bite".`
- If you turned on the above feature, Katana should not comment on when you commit what has an asterisk**. As well, the relationship should not be affected when you commit such acts.
- Use the Relationship Check spell to confirm what happens when you commit such acts.

### The Hunter's Pursuit
- Chadryn shows up immediately after recruiting Megara for the first time, outside the Drunken Huntsman.
- He can be found next in Solitude, outside Radiant Raiment.
- Next, he can be found between Riften (follow the pathway) and Fort Greenwall, hunting or enjoying the scenery.
- Next, he can be found by the bridge in Riverwood.
- Some scenes require Megara. All scenes require Katana. He has comments for if you do not have either with you.
- Chadryn should disappear 24 hours after the last scene.
- These locations are so spread out because you **aren't** meant to digest all of these scenes back-to-back, by the way.

### The Sweetest Carrot
- Go to the Bannered Mare, right by the bar. A forcegreet should occur.
- Play as someone that wants to help.
- Play as someone that refuses to help.
- Talk to Katana after each stage if you have her.

### The Khat's Eye
- Head to Moorside Inn in Morthal.
- Choose options like, "let's talk later" and try to continue the quest to see if I missed anything.
- Al'Tharo should disappear 24 hours after the last scene.

### Sugar and Spice
- This only gets triggered after The Sweetest Carrot has been brought to your attention.
- Go anywhere safe that is NOT Whiterun.
- Play with Megara in party.
- Play without Megara in party.
- Dismiss Katana and attempt to do the quest, and see if there are bugs. You shouldn't be able to progress without Katana.
- Choose sweet route.
- Choose spicy route.

### A Nutty Dispute
- Head to the outside of the Honningbrew Meadery.
- Let scene play. Anything weird?
- Read the note that Deepvos left on Azatar's body, if you can.
- They should head to the Bannered Mare when they are done.
- They should disappear 24 hours after the scene.
