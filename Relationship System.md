# Relationship System

### Enabling/Disabling Decrease (Version 2.0+)
- If you would like Katana to look the other way when you commit *certain* acts, talk to her and select `About my lifestyle...`
- You will get these notifications that confirm your choice:
  - `Katana will acknowledge all of your actions.` = DEFAULT TRUST.
  - `Katana will look the other way if you decide to partake in certain activities.` = NO TRUST DECREASE.

### Assessment
- Relationship level when you first meet Katana: `-5`
- Relationship max level: `10`

- minorAssessment = `0.05` 
- moderateAssessment = `0.2` 
- majorAssessment = `0.5` 

### General Idea
- Cautious: `-5` -- Katana won't say much to you.
- Civil: `0` 
-- Can trade and wait.
- Friendly: `2` -- Will do favors.
- Warm: `5` -- A true companion.
