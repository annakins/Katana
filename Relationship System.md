# Relationship System
### Assessment
- Relationship level when you first meet Katana: `-5`
- Relationship max level: `10`

- minorAssessment = `0.05` 
- moderateAssessment = `0.2` 
- majorAssessment = `0.5` 

### General Idea
- Cautious: `-5` -- Katana won't say much to you.
- Civil: `0` 
-- Can trade and wait.
- Friendly: `2` -- Will do favors.
- Warm: `5` -- A true companion.
